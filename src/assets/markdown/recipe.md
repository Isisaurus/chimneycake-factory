and the following ingredients:

Dough:

1 cup of milk
3 tablespoons of powdered sugar
1 pack of dry yeast
2 cups of all purpose flour
80 grams of butter
2 eggs
Pinch of salt
Toppings:

1-2 tablespoons cold butter
1 egg
1/2 cup of sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
Instructions:

Sourdough: Mix the yeast with a little warm milk and a little sugar. Put it in some warm place and cover by towel.
Dough: Mix all the remaining ingredients (note: milk must be warm, butter melted), and add the sourdough. Cover the dough with a towel and let it rise for 1 hour.
Mixture: Mix sugar with cinnamon or with almonds, walnuts, cocoa, coconut…
When the dough is ready, roll into a thick log and divide into 8 – 10 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a long rope, about 1 1/2 to 2 feet long (about 1/4” thick) and wrap 1 rope of dough around each butter-coated mold. Brush pastry with egg wash and then roll pastry in the mixture to coat, pressing down as you roll.
Bake in a preheated 350F degree oven for about 20 minutes. The Chimney Cakes must be turned around halfway through the cooking time. Remove from oven and carefully slide warm pastry. Best eaten while still warm.
