#The Chimney Cake[^1]

Kürtőskalács, sometimes improperly rendered as Kurtosh Kalach, is a spit cake specific to Hungarians from Transylvania, more specifically the Székelys. Originally popular in the Hungarian-speaking regions of Romania, more predominantly the Székely Land, it became popular in both, Hungary and Romania. The first written record dates back to 1679 and was found in the village of Úzdiszentpéter (now Sânpetru de Câmpie), while the first recipe appears in a manuscript cookbook dated in 1781. Earlier a festive treat, now it is part of everyday consumption. In Transylvania, a similar pastry to Kürtőskalács is Baumstriezel, originating from the Saxon communities.

Kürtőskalács is made from sweet, yeast dough (raised dough), of which a strip is spun and then wrapped around a truncated cone–shaped baking spit, and rolled in granulated sugar. It is roasted over charcoal while basted with melted butter, until its surface cooks to a golden-brown color. During the baking process the sugar stuck on the kürtőskalács caramelises and forms a shiny, crispy crust. The surface of the cake can then be topped with additional ingredients such as ground walnut or powdered cinnamon.

The name refers to a stovepipe (kürtő), since the fresh, steaming cake in the shape of a truncated cone resembles a hot chimney.

This opinion is shared by Attila T. Szabó, scholar and philologist from Cluj-Napoca: "...when taken off from the spit in one piece, the cake assumes the shape of a 25–30-centimetre [10–12 in] long vent or tube. Since the cake is served in this tubular form to family and guests, and consumers are faced with this typical, vent-like image of the dough to be torn off in strips, it is self-evident that its name must have been given with regard to the vent shape of the cake".

Throughout the centuries, miscellaneous alternate names and spellings of "kürtőskalács" have been used. More references were mentioned even in the 19th century (e.g. dorongfánk 'spit-donut' or botratekercs 'stick roll' or botfánk 'stick-donut'). The name "kürtőskalács" originated in Transylvania and became popular only by the middle of the 20th century. Until the end of the century it had different spellings (e.g. spelt with ‘ö’ as in kürtöskalács ('horn cake') or in two words, as in kürtős kalács. The present variant "kürtőskalács" was first used in print in a cookbook, published in 1926 by the book department of 'Brassói Lapok’, a newspaper from Brașov.

Measures to have kürtőskalács registered in the European Union as a Protected designation of origin (PDO) product have been taken.
